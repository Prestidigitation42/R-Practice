# Introduction to R: Vectors

# Variable assignment, define the variable vegas
vegas <- "Go!"

# Vector: One-dimension array that holds numeric, character, or logical data
# Assigned in R with combine function c()
numeric_vector <- c(1, 9, 25)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Create vectors to show daily wins and losses in poker and roulette
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Give names to the elements of a vector with the names() function
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Summing vectors takes element-wise sum
total_daily <- poker_vector + roulette_vector

# The sum() function calculates teh sum of all elements of a vector
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)
total_week <- sum(total_daily)

# Check whether winnings are higher in poker than roulette
total_poker > total_roulette # TRUE

# Use [] brackets to select specific elements of a vector
# Select poker results on Wednesday
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]
# Select poker and roulette results for the middle of the week
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2, 3, 4)]
roulette_midweek <- roulette_vector[2:4]
# Vectors subsets can also be selected via names of vector elements
start_end <- c("Monday", "Friday")
poker_start_end <- poker_vector[start_end]
roulette_start_end <- roulette_vector[start_end]

# The mean() function calculates the average of the values in a vector
poker_mean <- mean(poker_vector)
roulette_mean <- mean(roulette_vector)

# Selection by comparison (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
poker_positive <- poker_vector > 0
roulette_positive <- roulette_vector > 0
poker_winnings <- poker_vector[poker_positive]
roulette_winnings <- roulette_vector[roulette_positive]
