# Introduction to R: Lists
# 3/12/2023

# Create lists in R using the list() function. Lists can contain elements of
# several data types (unlike vectors, which must have a single data type)
my_vector <- 1:10
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)
# Lists can be assigned names in a similar fashion to vectors
names(my_list) <- c("vec", "mat", "df")
