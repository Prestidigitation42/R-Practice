# Foundations of Probability - Normal Distribution

# Normal Distribution
# Large samples from the binomial distribution approximate Normal distribution
binom_sample <- rbinom(100000, 1000, .2)
# Generate draws from the Normal distribution using function rnorm(a = sample
# size, b = expected value, c = standard deviation)
normal_sample <- rnorm(100000, 1000 * .2, sqrt(1000 * .2 * (1 - .2)))
# Compare the two distributions by create a histogram for each
hist(binom_sample)
hist(normal_sample)
# Flip 1,000 biased coins (heads 20%). What is the probability that 190 or fewer
# heads result?
# Estimate probability using the samples generated from the distributions
mean(binom_sample <= 190)
mean(normal_sample <= 190)
# Calculate the probability of 190 heads or fewer using pbinom
pbinom(190, 1000, .2) # 0.2273564
# Calculate the probabilty of 190 heads or fewer using pnorm
pnorm(190, 200, sqrt(160)) # 0.2145977
