# Geometric Distribution
# Simulate 100 flips of a single coin (heads 20%)
flips <- rbinom(100, 1, .2)
# Use the which() function to find the first case of heads
which(flips == 1) [1]
# Use replicate() function to simulate 100,000 trials waiting for first heads
replications <- replicate(100000, which(rbinom(100, 1, .2) == 1) [1])
# Plot a histogram of the results in replications
hist(replications)
# Use rgeom() function to simulate 100,000 draws from geometric distribution
# with probability .2
geom_sample <- rgeom(100000, .2)
